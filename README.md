# Face-and-handwritten-digit-recognition

- Developed a single-hidden-layer neural network model with a custom loss function using PyTorch to classify faces extracted from 100,000 images
- Tuned and optimized the model to beat benchmark accuracy by 7.5% through experimenting with learning rate, batch normalization, dropout, and various optimizers
- Visualized results and the learning process using matplotlib

## Digit Recognition

<b>Data</b>
- Work with the MNIST dataset.
- The digits already seprated into a training and a test set.
